"""
The idea is to ask the user about their website idea and their preferred backend and
frontend technologies. Then several GPT agents communicate together to create the website.

Ideas for improvements:
Teach the project lead to say the name of the party they wish to contact. E.g. if they think
that the backend needs modifications, it should say 'Backend architect' and then hit enter twice
before entering its questions/assertions. When the project lead thinks that the project is done,
it should say 'The project is done' and then provide download links, etc.
